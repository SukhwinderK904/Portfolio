				<h3>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Languages: Showcasing to the public through IT integration</h3>
				<p>This project is based on showcasing the aboriginal languages spoken by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait community in Queensland, which are on the edge of extinction.<br> The potential project to showcase Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages is creating a map with markers that are interactive. By clicking on each marker, a pop-up box opens containing the language of that location and a link for information about the language. It integrates the data related to the name and information on the languages on the map.
				 The concepts that are used to create an Aboriginal Language Map are Python programming language, Data Cleaning, RESTful web services, and Mashups.</p>
